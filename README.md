````

## Train, Validation and Test Splits
Splits are made in stratified fashion thus maintaining the weight imbalances in original dataset
Training - 70% of samples
Validation - 20% of samples
Testing - 10% of samples

## Models
#### Neural Network Model 
Neural Network Model is trained using manually extracted features and tokenized features with 1000 most frequently used words

#### Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is trained using TF-IDF features

## Configuration Parameters
#### Neural Network Model
Activation Functions - ReLU, Sigmoid

Loss Functions - Binary Cross Entropy Loss

Optimizer - Adam Optimizer

Evaluation Metrics - Accuracy, ROC-AUC
